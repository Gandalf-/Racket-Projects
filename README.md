# Racket Projects

This is a collection of my side projects in Racket. I'll continue to add more, and polish the existing ones. Maybe this'll have some good examples for someone learning to code in a functional language.

## Polished
- Binary-Encrypt
  * Various conversions between strings, decimal integers, and binary integers

- DividePrecise
  * Divide real numbers with arbitrary precision

- Hex-Encrypt
  * Various conversions between strings, decimal integers, hexidecimal integers

- Pi
  * Caluclates pi with arbitrary precision

- Primes
  * Calculates prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes

## Rough
- Alpha
  * Prints an random distribution of stars to the screen horizontally and vertically
   
- Basics
  * A short walkthrough on the basics of Racket.
  
- Binary-Decimal
  * Conversions between decimal and binary representations of positive integers

- Draw Tree (GUI)
  * Draws a graphical tree of arbitrary depth, width, span, and color

- FactorPrime
  * Finds the prime factors of integers

- Factorials
  * Basic calculation of factorials

- FibonacciApprox
  * Calculates the n'th Fibonacci number with various approximations

- GraphMe (GUI)
  * Graphically plots lists of integers or points

- Perfect
  * Calucates perfect numbers

- UnionIntersectExcept
  * Examples of the named set operations without using high level operations
 
- Wander (GUI)
  * Graphical worm of arbitrary speed and length wanders randomly around the screen

- Waterfall-Encrypt
  * Encryption algorithm that uses previous chunk of the message to encrypt the current chunk

- Xibonacci
  * Abstraction on the Fibonacci sequence to allow arbitrary starting values and number of factors. Look up "Tribonacci" for an example

## Broken
- Integration
  * Calculates approximate area under a function, within given bounds on the x-y plane

- Tau
  * Calculates pi or tau using a different heuristic
